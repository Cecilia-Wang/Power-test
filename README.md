# Power-test
Power test for avoiding false positive results using monte-carlo concept, particularly for enviromental samples or pooled samples with a mixture of species.
This piece of R code is designed for testing the signficance of differences between different groups based on their metadata.
The final results can be ploted as line graphs, with power as y axis and sample size as x axis. The plot will show at a certain sample size, how confident we are to tell the difference between groups base on selected metadata
